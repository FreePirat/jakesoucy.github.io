# Hey, I’m Jake Soucy. I build clean, user‑friendly software and websites.

I've always been a fan of technology, and ever since I've recently graduated from college, I'm always happy and excited to create new applications that display my ability to program, learn and build. If you're at all interested, please check out my portfolio [here](https://freepirat.github.io/jakesoucy.github.io/ "My Website"), and feel free to reach out as well through my contact page.
